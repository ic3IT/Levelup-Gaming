## Overview

Welcome to **Level Up**, a 3-level blockchain gaming challenge powered by Venium. This isn't just about completing tasksâ€”it's a way to improve your skills in blockchain game development. Each level has you working on a different game, while advancing your knowledge in smart contract development and blockchain integration.

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to help you learn by building simple blockchain-based games. Each level will introduce you to new concepts and development practices.
