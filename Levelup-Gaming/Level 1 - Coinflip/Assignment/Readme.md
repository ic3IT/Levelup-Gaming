## Tasks

1. **Smart Contract Development**
   - Implement the `CoinFlip.sol` contract with the following features:
     - Betting mechanism
     - Basic pseudo-random number generation
     - Payout calculation
     - Minimum bet limit

2. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Ensure game results are properly emitted as events
   - Implement a function to receive Ether

3. **Basic Security Measures**
   - Implement checks for minimum bet amount
   - Ensure the contract has sufficient balance for payouts

4. **Testing**
   - Test the `flipCoin` function with different inputs
   - Ensure proper error handling for invalid bets
   - Test the pseudo-random number generation

5. **Documentation**
   - Provide clear comments in your code
   - Create a README with setup, deployment, and interaction instructions

6. **Bonus Features** (Optional)
   - Implement a maximum bet limit
   - Add a simple house edge
   - Create a basic frontend interface for the game

## Submission Guidelines
- Deploy your contract to a testnet (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia)
- Submit the contract address and GitHub repository link
- Include a brief report on your development process and any challenges faced

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality and completeness of the CoinFlip game
- Correct implementation of betting and payout logic
- Proper use of events and error handling
- Code quality and organization
- Documentation clarity
- Understanding of the limitations of the current random number generation method

Note: While this assignment uses a basic pseudo-random number generation method for simplicity, be prepared to discuss its limitations and potential improvements for a production environment.

Good luck, and enjoy building your CoinFlip game!
