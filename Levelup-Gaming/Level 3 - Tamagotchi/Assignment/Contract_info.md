# Tamagotchi Contract Development Hints

When developing your Tamagotchi smart contract, consider the following aspects:

1. **State Variables**
   - `struct Pet`: Define properties like name, hunger, happiness, health, lastInteraction, and age
   - `mapping(address => Pet)`: Associate each pet with its owner's address

2. **Key Functions**
   - `createPet(string memory _name)`: Initialize a new Tamagotchi
   - `feed()`: Decrease hunger, potentially increase health
   - `play()`: Increase happiness, potentially increase hunger
   - `updateStatus()`: Update pet's health based on hunger and happiness levels
   - `getPetStatus()`: Return current pet stats including age

3. **Events**
   - `PetCreated(address owner, string name)`
   - `PetFed(address owner)`
   - `PetPlayed(address owner)`
   - `StatusUpdated(address owner, uint256 hunger, uint256 happiness, uint256 health, uint256 age)`

4. **Modifiers**
   - `onlyPetOwner`: Ensure only the pet owner can interact with it

5. **Time-Based Logic**
   - Use `block.timestamp` for time-based state changes and age calculation

6. **Error Handling**
   - Use `require` statements to enforce game rules and prevent invalid states

7. **Gas Optimization**
   - Use `storage` for Pet struct when modifying multiple properties
   - Combine state changes to reduce the number of storage writes

Remember to thoroughly test all functions and edge cases, and consider adding more advanced features like pet evolution or special abilities based on care quality.
